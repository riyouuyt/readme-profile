# Hi there <img src="https://github.com/riyouuyt/riyouuyt/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="30px"> I'm Rio 🧑🏻

<p align="justify">
  📚 I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights. I'm constantly exploring the vast universe of data, finding patterns, and solving problems.
🔬 My toolbox includes Python, R, SQL, and more. I love to dig deep into the data, whether it's structured or unstructured, and I'm always excited to learn new techniques and tools.
i'm also really interested on learning Machine Learing Algorithm and want to contribute on Machine Learning improvement.
